    OBJECTS
---------------
- As we Know that Variable can store only one single value into it but in JS we can store multiple value in one variable.
- In JS we can Store Multiple value in the single using the objects
- Object can we represented as the collection of the key-Value Pairs so that we can store Multiple value int single variable

    Example: 
    const personObject={
        firstName: "Ritesh",
        lastName: "Verma",
        age: 23
    }

- Now here we can see that there is the personObject which is having multiple keyvalue pairs like firstName lastName and age.
- Keys and Values can be of any type like Number,objects,Array,String etc.
- There can also be the nested Objects for Example: 

        const personObject={
            firstName: "Ritesh",
            lastName: "Verma",
            age: 23,
            address: {
                houseNumber: 23,
                city: Mathura,
                state: Uttar Pradesh,
                pinCode: 281004
            }
        }

- We can access inside object like: 
    personObject.firstName      // give Ritesh
    personObject.age            // give 23

- Looping in Objects: 
    for(let variable in personObject){

    }

- Adding new Property: 
    personObject.height= 6

- Deleting Property:
    delete personObject.height;
