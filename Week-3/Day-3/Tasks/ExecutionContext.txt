- Execution Context is the Internal Concept that describe the Internal Working of the Code.
- It describe that how any varible is created and worked Internally inside the JavaScript.
- There are two Phases inside the Execution Context
    * Memory Allocation Phase
    * Code Execution Phase
- These two phase is totally innvolved from the start to the end of the variable or functions etc.

* Memory Allocation Phase:
            - In Memory Allocation Phase, Let take an pointer which is moving from top to bottom of the lines in the program.
            - If that Pointer find any type of variable Decleration then that variable get space in the Memory only and Initialize it with undefined.
            - If that Pointer find any type of functions Decleration then that functions get space in the Memory with its body.
            - if that Pointer find any type of method calling or other things then those things get skipped at that time.

* Code Execution Phase: 
            - In Code Execution Phase, Our Code is get executed line by line
            - Here each variable get Initialize and method Calling is also done, for that perticular function, again the Execution Context is created.
            - Again the Execution Context is created inside the Execution phase and same thing is done for body of this function.
