 Promise: 
---------
- A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. 
- A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
        * Pending: The promise is still waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
        * Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.
        * Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the promise has an error.

    Example:

                const promise=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
                    let randomNumber=Math.random();
                    console.log(randomNumber);
                    if(randomNumber<0.5){
                        resolve("Inrange");
                    }
                    else{
                        reject("Not in range");
                    }
                })

                promise.then((data)=>{
                    console.log(data);
                    console.log("Promise Resolve");
                }).catch((data)=>{
                    console.log(data);
                    console.log("Promise Reject");
                })
