    EVENT LOOP
------------------
- Event Loop is the something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.

- Suppore we have a Api call or SetTimeout at that time there stuff get queued into the event queue and wait for execution.

- This event loop is used to provide the async behaviour into the Program.

- This Loops run until the Event Queue got Empty.

- Take every Stuff from the Queue and make it ready for execution.
