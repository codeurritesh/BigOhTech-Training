    Spread Opeartors
---------------------------------
- Spread operators are written using three consecutive dots (...)
- They provide us with an easy way to break up an array or an object into its individual elements.

    Example: 
            let array = [1, undefined, 3, 4]; 
            let newArray = [...array, 5];

    Rest operators
----------------------
- The rest operator is essentially the opposite of the spread operator 
- It collects multiple elements into an array 
- This is useful if you donâ€™t know how many arguments a function may receive, and you want to capture all of them as an array.

    Example: 
            function add(..numbers){

            }
