    CLOSURE
---------------
- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

- We can say that when a function is bounder together  with the lexical environment then it form an closure.

    Example:
                function fun(){
                    let num=100;
                    function increseNum(){
                        return num+1;
                    }
                    return increseNum;
                }
                let closureExample=fun();
                console.log(closureExample());

                - Now this function increseNum  will return with the variable that is used inside the the method this is called Closure.

- In this above Example we can say that function increseNum will get value of num which is variable of fun method by closure
