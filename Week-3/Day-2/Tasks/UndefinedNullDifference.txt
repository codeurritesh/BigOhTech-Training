    Undefined VS NULL
-------------------------
- Both Undefined and NULL is distinct thing but they shows a kind of same thing that the absence of the value in the variable

# Undefined: 
    - Undefined is gernally we can say that is the variable is defined but if it is not initialised int he Scope then it is called as Undefined.
    - Suppose we have an variable which is defined but not initialised then value of that variable is undefined
        Example: 
            let variable;
            console.log(variable);// it shows Undefined

            const variable;
            console.log(variable);// it shows Undefined

            function fun(value){
                console.log(value);// Print Undefined
            }
            fun();// We have not passed value

# NULL:
    - Null is gernally we can say that if the variable is intentionaly repersent the absence of any object
    - We can say that null is the absence of the value but it is given intentionaly.
        Example:
            let variable=null;// Here we are intentionaly providing the null value
            console.log(variable);// Here it will print NULL

             function fun(value){
                console.log(value);// Print NULL
            }
            fun(null);// We have passed NULL as value
