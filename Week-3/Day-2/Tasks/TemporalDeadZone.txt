 Temporal DeadZone
-------------------
- Dead Temporal Zone is the time period where the variable of let and Const is decleared but not initialized.

       Variable Decleared -----------------------------> Variable Initialized
                                    Time Duration

- This time period between decleared and initialized is called as the Dead Temporal Zone
- Let and Const variable can not be accessed in the dead Temporal Zone
- In case of var we know that variable is also initialized with Undefined automatically 
- But in case of the let and const it is not initialized thats why it is not accessable
