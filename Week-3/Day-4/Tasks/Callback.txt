 CallBack:
-----------
- A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the main function has finished executing.
- Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming, where a function needs to be executed after another function has completed its task.
- A Function which are passed as an argument to another, and invoked by that outer funciton.

    Example: 
        function fun(callbackFunction){
            callbackFunction();
        }
        fun(()=>{
            console.log("Callback function Called")
        })
