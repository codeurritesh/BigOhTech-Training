     Hoisting
--------------------
- In JavaScript Hoisting is the property where all the Variable decleration is come on top and this process is called Hoisting.
- We can access Methods and Variable before it is initialized.
- When the var Variable is Hoisted in the js program then memory Allocation is done for var Variable and initialized as Undefined
- When the normal function is Hoisted then it is Hoisted with their full function body
- So incase of normal function, we can use method before it is declered in program in working state
    Example: 
        console.log(data);// Print Undefined
        const data=10;

        console.log(add(10,20));// Print 30 as Answer
        function add(a,b){
            return a+b;
        }

- If we Talk about let and const variable decleration then they both are also Hoisted but difference is that it initialized by nothing 
  thats why we found an error while accessing the let const variable before decleration;
    Example: 
    console.log(data);// Shows error
    let data=5;

    console.log(data);// Shows error
    let data="Ritesh";
