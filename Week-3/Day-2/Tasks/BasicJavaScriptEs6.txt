    Basic JavaScript ES6
    --------------------

    # Let and Const:
    - Before ES6 We only declear variable using var only
    - ES6 Provide 2 more way of Declearing the variable using const and let
    - Where const provide the feature that if the variable is initialised once can not be modified in futiure
    - Where let provide us the feature that variable is decleared using let keyword then it will have block Scope

    # Arrow Function:
    - If we compare Arrow function with the tradition function then we say that Arrow function is the easy and short way to declear the function
        Example: 
            -> Tradition Function
                function add(a,b){
                    return a+b;
                }
            -> Arrow Function
                const add=(a,b)=>a+b;

    # Easy Syntax for interpolation:
    - After ES6 it is very easy to interpolation the String insted of using next line.
                Example: 
                    Console.log(`Area of Rectangle is: ${area} m^2`);

    # Distracting the Values:
    - After the ES6 it is very easy to extract value or element from the Array or the objects
    - we can easily extract the single of multiple value in any order
        Example:
            -> const [a,b]=[5,2];
                - Now in the a or b the value 5,2 is accesses independently
            -> const {name,age}={ name: "Ritesh verma", Address: "Mathure", age:23}
                - Now in the name and age we can easily asscessed from the Object.
    
    # Provide REST Opeartor:
    - After ES6 it is very easy to have method with unknown number of arguments by just using the REST Opeartor
    - It can be used using the three dots ...arguments
        Example: 
            -> function addValues(...values){ }
            -> Here in this function we can give any number of Arguments it just comes under the values variable in the form of Array.
    
    # Introduce the Promises:
    - Here in the ES6 the Promises is defined
    - Promises make code very easy to understand and manage the Asynchronous code
    - we can just create the Promises using the Promise class by creating the objects
        Example: 
            function fetchData(){
                return new Promise((reject,resolve)=>{
                    if(condition){
                        resolve(data)
                    }else{
                        reject(error)
                    }
                })
            }
