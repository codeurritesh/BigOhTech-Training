Regular Function vs Arrow Function
----------------------------------
There are the two different types of declearing the Function but the working is the same.

# Regular Function
    - We can defined the Regular function by using the function keyword
    - Have Accessed to the arguments object.
    - Here this refer to the calling context
    - Hoisting done
        Example:
            function add(a,b){
                console.log(a+b);// just return the a+b
                console.log(this)// this refer to the calling context
                console.log(arguments)// Accessed easily
            }

# Arrow Function
    - We can defined the Arrow function by using the '()=>' type
    - Not have Accessed to the arguments object.
    - Here this is inherited to surrounding Scope
    - Hoisting not done
        Example:
            const add=(a,b)=>{
                console.log(a+b);// just return the a+b
                console.log(this)// this refer to the surrounding Scope
                console.log(arguments)// Not Accessed easily
            }
