DeepCopy and ShelloCopy
-----------------------
- Deep and shello are the two method of copying the object
- DeepCopy can be explained as the process of copying with the values
- ShelloCopy can be explained as the process of copying with reference of original
- In deep if we change the value or update it then there will be no effect on the original one
- In ShelloCopy if we change the value or update it then there will be also change in the origina one

    Example of DeepCopy:
                const object1={
                    name:"Ritesh verma",
                    age:23,
                    Address:{
                        city:"Mathura",
                        state:"UP"
                    }
                }

                const object2={
                    name:"Ritesh verma",
                    age:23,
                    Address:{
                        city:"Mathura",
                        state:"UP"
                    }
                }
                
                object1.name="Shiva";
                console.log(object2.name);       // Prints Ritesh not gonna update

    Example of ShelloCopy:
            const object1={
                name:"Ritesh verma",
                age:23,
                Address:{
                    city:"Mathura",
                    state:"UP"
                }
            }
            const object2=object1;
            object2.name="Shiva";
            console.log(object1.name);       // Prints Shiva changes reflect
